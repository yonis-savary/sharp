# ðŸ¥¤ Session Straw

We all know it, using global variables is quite a bad habit, still, you sometimes have to work with a piece of data that you need in all your business code

Let's say you want to store your user permissions and access it any time,
one of the first solutions that comes to mind is to use the session to store it

```php
# Constant allow us to have autocompletion in the IDE
const USER_PERMISSION = "session.user.permission";

$session = Session::getInstance();

$session->set(USER_PERMISSION, [1,2,3]);

$permissions = $session->get(USER_PERMISSION);
```

It is readable, but not very practical, we can do better,
with the [`SessionStraw`](../../Classes/Extras/SessionStraw.php) trait

This trait is simply a way to transform a class into a global getter-setter that store its data to the session

```php
class UserPermission { use SessionStraw; }

UserPermission::set([1,2,3]);

$permission = UserPermission::get();
```

This way, you have a global variable that is stored in the session

### Creating a straw

To create a straw, you have two choices
- Manually, by creating a file then writing the class
- Using the `create-straw` command, which is quite faster

```bash
# The command will prompt you to type a straw name
php do create-straw

# You can also directly give it names
php do create-straw UserId UserPermissions
```
