# âœ… Testing the framework/apps

To test the framework :
1. Go to your project root directory
2. Launch `php do build` to install dependencies
3. Launch `php do test`

Launching the `test` command will execute every phpunit instances in your application(s)


## Testing the Framework : FTP

By default, FTP cannot be tested directly, it needs to be configured first

To test [`FTPDriver`](../../src/Classes/Env/Drivers/FTPDriver.php), edit `ftp-test` in your configuration

```php
return [
    new GenericConfiguration("ftp-test", [
        "username" => "foo",
        "password" => "bar",
        "port" => 21
    ])
];
```

> [!NOTE]
> `port` is set to 21 by default (which is the default FTP port)
